                <p> 
                We met in October 2009 at Lincoln College. Romantically, neither of us remembers how. Jack suggested making something up for the website. Becky was against it. We met on a volcano. We met on the moon.

We quickly became close friends. Jack wrote Becky letters when she had to take a couple of terms out in 2010. We had a lot in common, despite reading very different subjects. We performed at open mic nights together and kept each other company in the library.

We got engaged in December 2019. We picked the ring out together, settling on the first one Becky tried on and speeding up the timeline considerably as she got too excited! Jack then surprised Becky with a proposal on a walk with Tess the dog in Beckenham Place Park (who managed not to eat the ring). This was followed by sushi and champagne in Bromley and a special FaceTime to Bristol, arranged by Jack ahead of time.

                Lincoln is really special to us and the perfect place to begin our ‘next chapter’. We both knew we wanted to get married there even before getting engaged. What we didn’t know is that we needed a <a href="../img/AffidavitRedactedNuance.pdf">special licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. We have to get married in the daylight, in case one of us tries to swap the other out last minute.

We can’t wait to share our special day with you, celebrating our relationship and our marriage. 25th June 2022 baby! We would be honoured if you could be there.

<!--
Helpfully, we only got together just before graduation, in June 2013, meaning immediate long distance. However, we started living together in March 2016 and haven’t looked back since.
